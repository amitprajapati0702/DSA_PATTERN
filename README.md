# 🎯 Pattern Programs in C++

This repository contains **20+ pattern printing programs** written in **C++**, focused entirely on building logic using loops and conditionals.

These are commonly asked in **coding interviews**, **college practicals**, and help build a strong base in **logic development** and **problem-solving**.

- 💡 Logical Shape Patterns

Each file includes a **single pattern** with:
- Clear formatting
- Proper indentation
- Comments explaining the logic
